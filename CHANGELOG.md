# Changelog

## 3.5.5

### Patch Changes

- fix: tmux„Éö„Ç§„É≥„Çø„Ç§„Éà„É´Ë®≠ÂÆö„Å®„Éï„Ç©„Éº„Ç´„Çπ‰ΩçÁΩÆ„ÅÆ„Éê„Ç∞‰øÆÊ≠£

  Properly set unified branch name titles for all tmux panes and ensure focus is correctly set to the first pane (top-left).

  **Fixed:**
  - Use correct tmux pane specification format `sessionName:0.paneIndex` instead of `sessionName:paneIndex`
  - All panes now properly display the branch name as their title
  - Focus is correctly set to the first pane (0.0) after pane creation
  - Both new session and inside-tmux scenarios work correctly

  **Changes:**
  - Fixed `setTitleForAllPanes` function to use correct pane targeting format
  - Fixed `handleNewSessionPaneSplit` to focus on `sessionName:0.0` instead of `sessionName:0`
  - Added comprehensive tests for pane title and focus behavior

  Fixes #167, #169

## 3.5.4

### Patch Changes

- fix: Set unified branch name titles for all tmux panes

  When creating multiple tmux panes with options like `--tmux-h-panes` or `--tmux-v-panes`, all panes now display the branch name as their title instead of only the last pane. This provides better visual consistency and makes it easier to identify which worktree you're working in across all panes.

  Fixes #165

## 3.5.3

### Patch Changes

- fix: Complete elimination of duplicate error messages

  Removes the final redundant error display in executeCreateCommand that was causing
  triple error messages when tmux operations failed. Now shows clean, single error
  messages as intended.

  **Fixed behavior:**
  - Error messages now display only twice instead of three times
  - Eliminated redundant error output in CLI error handling
  - Cleaner error experience for users

  Completes fix for #163
  EOF < /dev/null

## 3.5.2

### Patch Changes

- fix: Reduce duplicate error messages in tmux pane creation

  When tmux pane creation fails due to insufficient screen space or other errors, the error message was displayed multiple times at different levels of the error handling chain. This fix consolidates error display to show clear, single error messages.

  **Fixed behavior:**
  - Error messages are now displayed once instead of 2-3 times
  - Better error handling hierarchy prevents redundant spinner failures
  - Cleaner user experience when tmux operations fail

  Fixes #163
  EOF < /dev/null

## 3.5.1

### Patch Changes

- feat: Add multi-pane support for tmux options (#157)
  - Added `--tmux-h-panes <number>` and `--tmux-v-panes <number>` options for creating multiple tmux panes
  - Added `--tmux-layout <type>` option for applying tmux layout (even-horizontal, even-vertical, main-horizontal, main-vertical, tiled)
  - Improved tmux integration with automatic layout application for optimal space usage

  fix: Improve tmux pane creation error handling (#161)
  - Enhanced error messages when tmux pane creation fails due to insufficient screen space
  - Better user feedback with specific guidance on resolution (e.g., "ÁîªÈù¢„Çµ„Ç§„Ç∫„Å´ÂØæ„Åó„Å¶„Éö„Ç§„É≥Êï∞„ÅåÂ§ö„Åô„Åé„Åæ„Åô")

  fix: Lazy initialization for tmux helper to resolve path resolution issues (#162)
  - Fixed issue where CLI commands failed when run from directories outside the maestro project root
  - Tmux helper path is now resolved only when tmux features are actually used
  - Non-tmux commands (like `config init`) now work correctly from any directory

  Fixes #159, #160
  EOF < /dev/null

## 3.5.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: Add CLI configuration commands (set/get/reset)

  **New Commands:**
  - `mst config get <key>` - Get configuration value using dot notation
  - `mst config set <key> <value>` - Set configuration value using dot notation
  - `mst config reset <key>` - Reset configuration value to default

  **Features:**
  - Dot notation support for nested configurations (e.g., `ui.pathDisplay`)
  - Automatic type conversion for boolean and number values
  - Schema validation ensures only valid configurations are saved
  - Auto-creates `.maestro.json` if it doesn't exist
  - Removes empty nested objects after reset operations

  **Examples:**

  ```bash
  mst config set ui.pathDisplay relative
  mst config set development.autoSetup false
  mst config get worktrees.path
  mst config reset ui.pathDisplay
  ```

  Fixes #152

## 3.4.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: Add configurable path display format (absolute/relative)

  **New Feature:**
  - Added `ui.pathDisplay` configuration option in `.maestro.json`
  - Choose between `"absolute"` (default) or `"relative"` path display
  - Affects path display across all major commands

  **Affected Commands:**
  - `mst create` - Creation confirmation message
  - `mst list` - Worktree listing (respects configuration)
  - `mst where` - Current location display
  - `mst delete` - Deletion confirmation
  - `mst sync` - Sync target selection

  **Configuration Example:**

  ```json
  {
    "ui": {
      "pathDisplay": "relative" // or "absolute"
    }
  }
  ```

  **Benefits:**
  - Consistent path display across all commands
  - User preference for compact (relative) or explicit (absolute) paths
  - Better integration with different workflow preferences

  Fixes #150

## 3.3.5

### Patch Changes

- üêõ Fix: Inquirer prompt fails due to Promise.allSettled conflict (Issue #148)

  **What was fixed:**
  - Separated tmux session creation from parallel task execution in `executePostCreationTasks`
  - Added TTY environment check before showing interactive prompts
  - Non-TTY environments now skip prompts and show manual attach instructions

  **Technical details:**
  - Interactive tmux confirmation prompts were conflicting with concurrent Promise execution
  - Now executes non-interactive tasks (setup, editor, CLAUDE.md) in parallel first
  - Then runs tmux session creation separately to avoid stdin/stdout conflicts
  - Prevents "User force closed the prompt" errors in inquirer

  **User impact:**
  - Interactive tmux attach confirmation now works reliably
  - Non-TTY environments (CI, scripts) gracefully skip prompts
  - Better user experience with proper prompt handling

  Fixes #148

## 3.3.4

### Patch Changes

- Use existing shell script helper for tmux auto-attach TTY fix

  **Fixed:**
  - üöÄ Integrated existing `scripts/maestro-tmux-attach` shell script that uses proper `exec()` system call
  - üõ†Ô∏è Resolved persistent TTY corruption when using `--tmux`, `--tmux-h`, `--tmux-v` options
  - ‚ú® Proper process replacement ensures tmux gets full TTY control
  - üéØ No more keyboard input corruption or terminal breakage after detach

  **Technical Details:**
  - Utilizes shell's `exec` command for true process replacement
  - Avoids Node.js process lingering and competing for TTY control
  - Works immediately without requiring C compilation

  Fixes #142

## 3.3.3

### Patch Changes

- Critical fixes for tmux TTY corruption and spinner hanging issues

  **Fixed:**
  - üö® Resolved severe TTY corruption when using tmux auto-attach options (`--tmux`, `--tmux-h`, `--tmux-v`)
  - üêõ Fixed spinner hanging indefinitely when specifying non-existent issue/PR numbers
  - üîß Improved tmux session environment handling with proper PATH configuration
  - üõ°Ô∏è Added maestro-exec helper for proper process replacement in tmux attach

  **Impact:**
  These fixes resolve critical issues that made tmux integration features unusable and could leave terminals in a corrupted state requiring restart.

## 3.3.2

### Patch Changes

- fix: tmux session attachment issues
  - Fixed tmux auto-attach breaking terminal input handling by using spawn instead of execa for proper TTY handling (#130)
  - Fixed custom PS1 not being applied in tmux sessions by using login shell (#128)
  - Added dedicated `attachToTmuxSession` and `switchTmuxClient` functions to handle TTY correctly
  - Resolved issue where Ctrl+C would terminate the mst process instead of being handled by tmux
  - Ensured tmux key bindings work properly after auto-attach

## 3.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix worktree self-deletion causing ENOENT error

  Resolves issue where attempting to delete a worktree from within the worktree directory itself would cause a `spawn git ENOENT` error and leave the system in an inconsistent state (directory deleted but branch remaining).

  **Changes:**
  - Added validation to prevent worktree self-deletion attempts
  - Enhanced error messages with clear guidance for correct usage
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for directory validation scenarios

  **Fixed behavior:**
  - Users are now warned when trying to delete a worktree from within itself
  - Proper error message guides users to run the command from outside the worktree
  - Prevents system inconsistency and manual cleanup requirements

  Fixes #126

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add automatic tmux session cleanup when deleting worktrees

  ### New Features
  - **Automatic tmux session cleanup**
    - `mst delete` now automatically removes associated tmux sessions
    - Prevents accumulation of orphaned tmux sessions
    - Improves system resource management

  ### Options
  - **--keep-session flag**
    - Use `mst delete <branch> --keep-session` to preserve tmux session
    - Maintains backward compatibility for users who want to keep sessions

  ### Benefits
  - Eliminates manual tmux session cleanup
  - Prevents "duplicate session" errors on recreation
  - Reduces memory usage from orphaned sessions
  - Provides consistent worktree lifecycle management

  Resolves: #122

  - **Add status badges**
    - CI workflow badge
    - Coverage status badge (‚â•80%)
  - **Enhance visual presentation**
    - Demo animation placeholder
    - Updated table of contents

  ### Why This Matters
  - Users can now easily find update commands for their installation method
  - Professional documentation follows CLI tool best practices
  - Reduces support questions about "how to update"
  - Improves first-time user experience with clear requirements

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Enhance tmux integration and improve documentation

  ### New Features
  - **Auto-attach to tmux session when using --tmux-h/--tmux-v from terminal**
    - Now `--tmux-h` and `--tmux-v` options work consistently with `--tmux`
    - When run from terminal, automatically creates and attaches to tmux session
    - Maintains existing behavior when run inside tmux (pane splitting with auto-focus)
    - Resolves UX inconsistency where users had to manually start tmux sessions

  ### Documentation Improvements
  - **Add comprehensive documentation for claude.markdownMode configuration**
    - Added detailed explanation of `"shared"` vs `"split"` modes
    - Updated README.md and README.ja.md with configuration table
    - Enhanced docs/COMMANDS.md with practical examples

  - Improved command consistency across all `--tmux*` options
  - Better error handling for tmux session creation and attachment

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Add tmux auto-focus and refactor --claude option to --claude-md

  ### New Features
  - **Auto-focus to new pane when using --tmux-h/--tmux-v options**
    - New tmux panes now automatically receive focus after creation
    - Eliminates manual pane switching for immediate development workflow
    - Uses `tmux select-pane -l` to focus the last created pane
    - Fixes #105
  - **Simplified --claude option to --claude-md**
    - Renamed `--claude` to `--claude-md` for clearer purpose indication
    - Focuses specifically on CLAUDE.md file management
    - Removed non-functional autoStart and initialCommands features
    - Simplified configuration and reduced complexity
    - Fixes #112

  ### Improvements
  - Streamlined tmux workflow with seamless pane focus management
  - Better semantic naming for Claude Code integration options
  - Reduced configuration complexity for better maintainability

## 3.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix EEXIST error when using --claude option with existing CLAUDE.md

  Resolves issue where `mst create <branch> --claude` would fail with EEXIST error when CLAUDE.md already exists in the worktree. Git worktree creation automatically copies all files from the root directory, including CLAUDE.md, but the --claude option was attempting to create a symlink without removing the existing file first.

  Changes:
  - Delete existing CLAUDE.md in worktree before creating symlink in shared mode
  - Add graceful error handling for cases where the file doesn't exist
  - Include comprehensive test coverage for the fix

  Fixes #106

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#108](https://github.com/camoneart/maestro/pull/108) [`3684416`](https://github.com/camoneart/maestro/commit/368441684d5dbdb4e4630eec9d6d827738dc8e50) Thanks [@camoneart](https://github.com/camoneart)! - Remove non-functional `mst claude` command

  The `mst claude` command has been removed due to fundamental design issues:
  - Claude Code is an interactive CLI tool that cannot run as a background process
  - The "start/stop" concept is not applicable to Claude Code
  - Commands appeared to work but were actually non-functional

  **Breaking Change**: The `mst claude` command and its subcommands (`start`, `stop`, `list`) are no longer available.

  **Migration**: Use the `claude` command directly in your worktrees. The `--claude-md` option for `mst create` remains available for CLAUDE.md generation.
